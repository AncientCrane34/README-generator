  ## Description:
  As a developer: I want to create a readme generator to quickly create a readme file quickly.
  ## Installation Instructions:
  You will need to install node.js and run 'npm install inquirer' for this program to work.
  ## Usage:
  Navigate to the index.js file on a command line. Type in node index.js to start the program. Answer all the questions, typing in N/A if not needed. When finished, a readme.md file will be created, and you can move it to wherever you need it.
